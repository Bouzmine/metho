####This app is being worked on

This app (iOS only currently) permits to students of the *École d'Éducation internationale* of McMasterville, Quebec aka *ÉÉI* to make bibliographic references automagically. It currently doesn't work, as it's being developed. 

This app is intended to go live into the iOS' App Store and Android's Google Play Store when ready. You can try and install the app in it's current stage by downloading the source code and sideloading it. Mac OS X is needed to sideload apps to iOS.



**Note :** This app is only tested in iOS for the moment. Android will be tested later.
